# BlinkFlash

A music visualizer for the BlinkStick adapted from Will Yager's LED music visualizer project: http://yager.io/LEDStrip/LED.html

BlinkFlash analyzes the loudness of each frequency bucket in your music, assigns each bucket a color with lower frequencies being on the redder end of the spectrum, and the highest frequencies being blue. Each bucket is drawn onto the strip, with louder frequencies being both brighter and larger, taking up more space on the strip. Overall gives a nice shimmery effect on gentle music with a spread of frequencies, and really accentuates percussion on more energetic music, overall I think this one might be my favorite!
