# BlinkFlash

A music visualizer for the BlinkStick adapted from Will Yager's LED music visualizer project: http://yager.io/LEDStrip/LED.html

Finds the loudest frequency, assigns it a hue according to its frequency and a brightness according to its loudness and creates a scrolling stream of these colors. Looks good even with few LEDs, although with lots of LEDs (like the BlinkStick Flex) it looks better with looping (enabled by default).
